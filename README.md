AsiaCoin v2.0.0.0 

This is the Official fix for Asiacoin, changes include:

  - Blocks address of premine wallet holding 3.2B so it cannot be used to either trade or stake (this is the key change!)
  - Allow for 1% staking even after 10 years.. ad infinitum
  - New POS schedule: 100% -> 1% over 4 years, gradual decline
  - Reverted many of the original bad code used to hide the premine, made premine explicit in code
  - Integrated new logo and icons

  - edited makefile and qt.pro file to build on windows
